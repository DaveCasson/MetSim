# Contributing to MetSim

## Bug reports and feature requests

If you experience any bugs or have use cases we have not considered feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/MetSim/issues).
When opening a new issue we request that you:

 * Mention any specific library versions
 * Provide code snippets as necessary
 * Provide sample datasets as necessary

We are open to taking feature requests, but are unlikely to act quickly on them.
If you would like to implement a feature we would be happy to include it in future releases.
To contribute a new feature we ask you to submit a pull request.

## Submitting a pull request

Whether you are updating documentation, fixing bugs, or implementing new features we are excited to work together!
When submitting a pull request we ask that you:

* Use pep8 style guides
* Provide documentation of any new features
* Only submit a single fix/feature per pull-request
* Update dependencies as necessary
